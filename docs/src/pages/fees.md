# Fees

The current contracts charge **0.1% of the quoted deposit amount**, rounded down, plus a gas charge in the deposit token. The selected pool's own fee also applies. Any excess balance stays recoverable.

Public deposits are coming soon. Launch gas limits have not been chosen; the USDC
example below uses local test tokens, not a live quote.

The factory fixes each supported token's ceiling:

```text
maximum gas charge = fixed allowance + deposit amount × basis points / 10,000
```

The 0.1% service fee is separate. Quotes can change without changing the address,
but cannot exceed this ceiling or consume the whole deposit. The charge is quoted;
it does not measure actual gas spent. The relayer can charge up to the ceiling.
The contract enforces this maximum, not the estimate displayed by the app.

Privacy Pools v2 quotes must preserve the net amount in the prepared deposit proof.

The local factory uses a test allowance of 2 USDC plus 0.5%; the demo's actual gas
charge is 0.2 USDC.

## Local example

For a **100 USDC** demo deposit (local test tokens), using the fixed gas charge and 0.25% RAILGUN fee:

| | USDC |
| --- | ---: |
| Service | 0.1 |
| Gas | 0.2 |
| RAILGUN | 0.24925 |
| **Private receipt** | **99.45075** |

Fees are paid only when shielding succeeds. Failed transactions still cost the caller gas. [Recovery](/recovery) charges no service fee.
